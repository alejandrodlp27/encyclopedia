\begin{defin*}
  A \emph{covering} is the triplet $(E,p,X)$ where $E$ and $X$ are topological spaces and
  $p:E\ra X$ a continuous function such that: for all $x\in X$ there exists an open
  neighborhood $V\subseteq X$ around $x$ such that for each component $U_i$ of $p^{-1}[V]$,
  that is $f^{-1}[V]=\bigsqcup U_i$, the restriction $p|_{U_i}:U_i\ra V$ is a homeomorphism.

  The space $E$ is called the \emph{total space}, $X$ is the \emph{base space} and
  each $E_x:=p^{-1}[x]$ is the \emph{fiber} of $x\in X$.

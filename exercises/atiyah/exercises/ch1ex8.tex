\subsection*{%
Prove that the prime ideals of $A$, i.e. $\spec{A}$, has minimal elements with respect
to inclusion.
} 

%%% ANSWER
\begin{proof}%
We shall prove this by applying Zorn's Lemma $\spec{A}$. Let $\p_1\supseteq\p_2\supseteq\cdots$
be a descending chain of prime ideals. If we prove that:
\[
	\p=\bigcap_{i=1}^{\infty}\p_i \quad\text{is prime},
\]
then every descending chain in $\spec{A}$ has a minimum in $\spec{A}$, in this case $\p$.
By Zorn's Lemma we would then conclude that $\spec{A}$ has minimal elements with respect
to inclusion.

Thus we have reduced the exercise to proving that the intersection of a descending
sequence of prime ideals is again prime. Suppose, $fg\in \p$, then there exists an $n\in\NN$
such that $fg\in\p_n$. Since $\p_n$ is prime then $f\in\p_n\subseteq\p$ or
$g\in\p_n\subseteq\p$; thus proving that $\p$ is prime.

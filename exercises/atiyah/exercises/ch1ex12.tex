Let $(A,\m,k)$ be a local field. Prove that $A$ contains no nontrivial idempotent. That
is an element $e\neq 0,1$ such that $e^2=e$.
} 

%%% ANSWER
\begin{proof}%
We prove that the only idempotents of $A$ are 0 and 1. Let $e$ be an idempotent of $A$.
If $e\not\in\m$, then, since $A$ is a local ring, $e$ is a unit. However, an idempotent
who is also a unit must be 1 because:
\begin{equation}\label{lem:idempotentunit}
	e\;\text{is a unit and}\; e^2=e \quad\then\quad e=e^{-1}e^2=e^{-1}e=1.
\end{equation}
Thus if $e\not\in\m$ then $e=1$.

Now suppose that $e\in\m$. This means that $1-e\not\in\m$ because, $e+(1-e)=1\not\in\m$,
and thus $1-e$ is a unit. On the other hand $1-e$ is idempotent because:
\[
	(1-e)^2=1-e-e+e^2=1-e-e+e=1-e.
\]
By (\ref{lem:idempotentunit}) we necessarily have $1-e=1$ which implies that $e=0$.

We conclude that the only two values $e$ can have are 0 and 1 depending on wether
$e$ is in $\m$ or not. Thus the local ring $A$ does not contain nontrivial idempotents.

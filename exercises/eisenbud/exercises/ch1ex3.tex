%%% ANSWER
\begin{proof} $\;$\\ %
$(\then)$ Suppose $M$ is noetherian. Let $N'\leq N$ be a submodule of $N$, then clearly $N'$ is a submodule
of $M$ and thus it is finitely generated. Now let $N'$ be a submodule of $M/N$. By the Correspondence Theorem,
there is a submodule $N''\leq M$ that contains $N$ such that $N''\mapsto N'$ under the canonical projection
$M\epi M/N$. Since $M$ is noetherian, $N''$ is finitely generated, say $N''=\gen{f_1,\ldots,f_n}$.

Now let $f+N\in N'=N''/N$ with $f\in N''$ so that there exist $\la_1,\ldots,\la_n\in R$ such that
$f=\la_1 f_1+\cdots +\la_n f_n$. By projecting this equality via $M\epi M/N$ we conclude that
$f+N=(\la_1 f_1+N)+\cdots +(\la_n f_n+N)$ and thus $f+N\in \gen{f_1+N,\ldots,f_n+N}$. Therefore $N'=N''/N$
is finitely generated by $\{f_1+N,\ldots,f_n+N\}$ and $M/N$ is noetherian.

$(\onlyif)$ Suppose that both $N$ and $M/N$ are noetherian and let $M'\leq M$ be a submodule. By the Second
Isomorphism Theorem we have that
\[
	\frac{M'}{M'\cap N}\cong\frac{M'+N}{N}.
\]
The right hand side is a submodule of $M/N$ so that it is finitely generated and thus
$M'/(M'\cap N)=\gen{f_1+(M'\cap N),\ldots,f_n+(M'\cap N)}$ for some $f_1,\ldots,f_n\in M'$.

Now $M'\cap N$ is a submodule of $N$ and thus finitely generated so that $M'\cap N=\gen{g_1,\ldots,g_m}$ for
some $g_1,\ldots,g_m\in M'\cap N\subseteq M'$. We confirm that $\{f_1,\ldots,f_n,g_1,\ldots,g_m\}$ generate
$M'$.

Let $f\in M'$. If we project onto $M'\cap N$ then $f+(M'\cap N)$ is generated by $\{f_1+(M'\cap N),\ldots,f_n+(M'\cap N)\}$.
That is there are $\la_1,\ldots,\la_n\in R$ such that:
\[
	f+(M'\cap N)=\la_1 f_1+(M'\cap N) +\cdots + \la_n f_n+(M'\cap N).
\]
This equality means that $f-\la_1f_1-\cdots -\la_nf_n\in M'\cap N=\gen{g_1,\ldots,g_m}$ and thus there exist
$\mu_1,\ldots,\mu_m\in R$ such that $f-\la_1f_1-\cdots-\la_nf_n=\mu_1g_1+\cdots+\mu_m g_m$ or equivalently:
\[
	f=\la_1f_1+\cdots+\la_nf_n+\mu_1g_1+\cdots+\mu_m g_m.
\]
We can therefore conclude that $f\in\gen{f_1,\ldots,f_n,g_1,\ldots,g_m}$ and we are done.

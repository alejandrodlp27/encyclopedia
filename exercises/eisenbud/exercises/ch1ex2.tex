Let $R$ be a noetherian ring and $I\leq R$ an ideal. Define $\V{I}:=\{\p\in\spec{R}\mid I\subseteq\p\}$ as the set of
prime ideals that contain $I$. Prove that there are only finitely many prime ideals in $\V{I}$ that are minimal with
respect to inclusion.

%%% ANSWER
\begin{proof}%

First denote $\min(\V{I})$ for the set of minimal prime ideales that contain $I$.

Suppose that there is an ideal $I$ such that $\V{I}$ doesn't have a finite number of minimal primes, that is $\abs{\min(\V{I})}=\infty$.
Since $R$ is noetherian, then the set $\Omega$ of such ideals that don't have a finitely many minimal prime ideals has a maximal
element say $J$. Clearly $J$ isn't a prime ideal because $J$ would be the only minimal prime of $\V{J}$.
Therefore there exist $f,g\not\in J$ such that $fg\in J$. 

Now consider the ideals $J_f=J+\gen{f}$ and $J_g=J+\gen{g}$ that strictly contain $J$ (because $f,g\not\in J$); this
means $J_f,J_g\not\in\Omega$ since $J\in\Omega$ is maximal. Thus $\V{J_f}$ and $\V{J_g}$ have finitely many minimal primes
or in symbols $\min(\V{J_f})$ and $\min(\V{J_g})$ are finite.

Let $\p\in\min(\V{J})$ be a minimal prime containing $J$ and suppose that $\p$ does not contain $J_f$ nor $J_g$. This means that
$f,g\not\in\p$ and since $\p$ is prime, then $fg\not\in\p$. However $fg\in J\subseteq\p$ which is a contradiction. Thus $\p$
must contain either $J_f$ or $J_g$. Furthermore, if $\q\subseteq\p$ is a prime ideal that contains $J_f$ or $J_g$ then clearly
$\q$ contains $J$ and thus, by the minimality of $\p$ we have $\p=\q$. Therefore $\p$ is a minimal prime containing $J_f$ or $J_g$.

We have just proven that if $\p\in\min(\V{J})$ then $\p\in\min(\V{J_f})\cup\min(\V{J_g})$ or equivalently
\[
	\min(\V{J})\subseteq\min(\V{J_f}) \cup \min(\V{J_g}).
\]
Since both $\min(\V{J_f})$ and $\min(\V{J_g})$ are finite then $\min(\V{J})$ is also finite which contradicts the definition of
$J$. Thus every ideal of $R$ has finitely many minimal prime ideals that contain it.
